# Loan Amount Prediction

This project aims to predict loan approval amounts based on applicant details such as income, credit history, employment status, and other relevant features.  
It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning modeling to build a predictive system.

## Objectives:
- Understand the key factors influencing loan approval.
- Build a regression/classification model to predict loan status or amount.
- Evaluate model performance and improve it using tuning techniques.

## Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
